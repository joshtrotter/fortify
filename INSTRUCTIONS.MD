<h1>How To Play</h1>
<ul>
        <li> On your turn, click on an unclaimed (white) tile to <b>claim</b> it </li>
        <li> When you claim a tile any neighbouring tiles owned by your opponent will be <b>captured</b> </li>
        <li> Any neighbouring tiles owned by you will become <b>fortified</b> </li>
        <li> A fortified tile is not captured when the opponent claims a neighbouring tile, instead it will lose its fortification </li>
        <li> Instead of claiming a new tile on your turn you can choose to <b>sacrifice</b> one of your fortified ones by clicking on it </li>
        <li> A sacrificed fortification will capture or remove the fortification of all neighbouring tiles owned by your opponent </li>    	
    	  <li> Once all tiles have been claimed the game will immediately end and the player with the most claimed tiles will be the winner</li>        	    	 
</ul>
